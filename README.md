# CRUD Application with React, Material UI, and PostgreSQL

Overview
This project is an enhancement of our previous todo application. In this version, we have integrated Material UI for a modern look and feel, and connected to a PostgreSQL database using Sequelize for data management. The application supports all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, includes a login page, and utilizes React hooks and Formik for form handling.

## Features
- CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete todo items.
- Material UI: Enhanced styling and design using Material UI components.
- Sequelize & PostgreSQL: Backend integration with PostgreSQL via Sequelize ORM.
- Login Page: A secure login page that redirects to the todo application.
- Loading State: Indicators to show loading states.
- Dialog Popups: Interactive dialog popups for user actions.
  
## Installation
#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crud-application.git

cd crud-application
```

#### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required packages.

```bash
cd client
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled formik
```

## Explanation:

- @mui/material and @emotion/react are required for Material UI components and styling.
- formik is used for handling form state and validation.
  
#### 3. Install Backend Dependencies
Navigate to the backend directory and install the required packages.

```bash
cd ../server
npm install sequelize pg pg-hstore
```
## Explanation:

- sequelize is the ORM used to interact with PostgreSQL.
- pg is the PostgreSQL client for Node.js.
- pg-hstore is a module for serializing and deserializing JSON data into PostgreSQL's hstore format.
  
#### 4. Setup Sequelize
Initialize Sequelize
Run the following command to initialize Sequelize.

```bash
npx sequelize-cli init
```
This command creates the necessary configuration and folder structure.

Configure Database
Edit the config/config.json file to include your PostgreSQL database credentials.

json
```bash
{
  "development": {
    "username": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password",
    "database": "your_database",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "postgres"
  }
}
```

## Create Models
To create a new model, use the following command:

```bash
npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name Todo --attributes title:string,completed:boolean
```
This will generate a new model and migration file for the Todo entity.

Run Migrations
Apply the migrations to create the database schema.

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
Basic Usage
Frontend
Start the React Application

cd client
npm start
```
Navigate to the Application
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.

Backend
Start the Server
bash
Copy code
cd server
npm start
API Endpoints

POST /api/login: Endpoint for user login.
GET /api/todos: Fetch all todo items.
POST /api/todos: Create a new todo item.
PUT /api/todos/:id: Update a specific todo item.
DELETE /api/todos/:id: Delete a specific todo item.
Development
For development purposes, you may want to use tools such as nodemon for auto-reloading the backend server. Install it globally with:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g nodemon
Then, start the server with:

bash
Copy code
nodemon server.js
